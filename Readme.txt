Project Outcome: Identify and analyze user needs and to take them into account in the  selection, creation, integration, evaluation, and administration of computing-based systems.

Project Overview: In this project I have been tasked with building a network IP strategy for Newton Ad Agency, which is a startup with three locations. The headquarters are located in AustinTX, with a satellite office located 2 miles away in a rural area. New York offices needed to share large media files with the Austin office and also required clients to download large media files quickly. We had a limited budget of $1100 per month, and our first task was to assign IP addresses for each site that will accommodate Newton Ad Agencyâ€™s needs.

Justification:  For this project certain requirements like locations, existing systems and the Networking and telecommunication aspect of linking the three Offices together were required. An analysis of identified user needs was conducted, and recommendations were presented to the client for this project. The knowledge, skills, and abilities that were needed to demonstrate competency while creating this artifact were knowledge/expertise in creating a Network Upgrade and maintenance plan proposal. Additionally, knowledge of applicable hardware and custom software that would be required is needed. Specific components of this artifact that showcase my skills are, the network upgrade and maintenance plan proposal recommendations and requirements, showing that knowledge of the networking, hardware and software required is a necessary skill.

Reflection/Articulation of Response: What I learned while creating this artifact is that every organization needs a security audit at some point to assess the need for additional security measures. Also, I learned about how to replace a legacy system with simple solutions that add to the networks capacity and performance. Challenges I faced were minor for this project, because of its fictitious nature only speculation to issue mitigation could be performed. If I was to redo this artifact again I would not do anything differently as it was as straight forward as possible. This artifact set me up for the real world by introducing me to what I may actually face as a network consultant aging hardware and improperly configured equipment and miss-trained employees
